# CONTEXT_ECONOMY

> Context is a budget, not a landfill. Standards-following must get CHEAPER over time, never heavier.

## session_injection

- `budget`: 6000 _(chars, TOTAL additionalContext from the SessionStart hook)_
- `composition`: contract (fixed) + catalog (names only) + open lessons (open only) + failures (only when failing)
- `rule`: scopes/rules/details are ONE READ away (INDEX.yaml -> <NAME>.yaml) — never injected wholesale
- `enforced_by`: scripts/verify-standards-meta.mjs _(check 11 pipe-runs the hook and fails over budget)_

## agent_economy

- `read_scope`: an agent reads ONLY the standards in its standards_used list (+ INDEX for routing) — never sweeps the tree
- `output_contract`: strict verbatim-lines-only report formats with hard line caps — transcripts, file dumps, and narration never return to the orchestrator
- `model_fit`: haiku for mechanical run-and-quote work; sonnet only where judgment is the job
- `dispatch_rule`: one focused brief in, one capped report out; follow-ups via SendMessage to the same agent instead of re-briefing a new one
- `offload_rule`: token-heavy transient work (multi-file reads, wide searches, gate/test transcripts, open-ended
  investigation) MAY be dispatched to a pinned-cheap agent when the offload genuinely nets a saving — but only after
  the cheaper inline remedies (dispatch_discipline.prefer_inline) are exhausted. Dispatch is not the default reflex;
  it is the move when inline can no longer keep the loop lean.
- `offload_enforced_by`: hooks/context-bloat-guard.mjs _(PostToolUse: nudges when an inline)_
  _read/search/gate burst crosses the char threshold; leads with inline-summarize/trim, offload second;_
  _resets on subagent dispatch. Advisory (never blocks the tool). Disable with CONTEXT_BLOAT_GUARD=off._

## dispatch_discipline

- `default`: inline — Claude Code does the work in-session by reading the relevant <agent>.md as SOP
- `self_adjudicated`: the session decides whether a dispatch clears the bar; it NEVER prompts the user for per-dispatch approval. In autonomous runs the same self-gate applies with no user in the loop.
- `prefer_inline`: _(before dispatching ANY agent, exhaust the cheaper remedies first)_
  - summarize the finding inline and drop the raw output from working context
  - drop stale / no-longer-needed context rather than moving fresh work out
  - narrow the read (fewer files, tighter grep, targeted line ranges) so it never bloats
- `dispatch_only_when`: _(only after prefer_inline is exhausted AND at least one holds)_
  - `net_saving_offload`: the transient work is heavy enough that a subagent absorbing it (returning a capped report) saves more main-loop tokens across the remaining session than the subagent costs
  - `isolation_required`: parallel file mutation that would conflict inline (worktree)
  - `fresh_context_required`: a reproducibility / repo-blind exercise that must NOT see current context
  - `genuinely_bulk`: "more than 5 near-identical targets where clean capped output materially beats inline"
  - `heavy_verifier`: verifier Mode C / D
- `teams_effectively_never`: a multi-agent team (2+ full-context teammates) is the ~7x case — dispatch one ONLY when the task cannot be done any other way, with an explicit one-line justification. A team for speed or tidiness alone is NON-COMPLIANT.
- `justify`: every dispatch states in one line which dispatch_only_when case it clears and why inline is genuinely worse — a discipline the session applies to itself, recorded in its own reasoning, not a user-facing permission request
- `cheapest_model`: pick the cheapest model that fits (haiku for mechanical; sonnet only where judgment is the job) — model_fit still applies on top of the dispatch decision

## ledgers

- `injection`: decisions inject at question-time only (pre-ask hook); lessons inject open-only; terminated entries live on disk, not in context

## handoff_checkpoints

- `law`: a long or context-heavy session must not let its state die in an uncontrolled compaction. It checkpoints to `docs/handoffs/HANDOFF.md` — a small, forward-looking launchpad a FRESH session boots from — instead of carrying (or `--resume`-ing) accumulated bloat. Continuous work is a chain of bounded sessions stitched by handoffs, not one immortal session.
- `when`: on user command; "every so often" during long runs (per milestone / at a context-size nudge); and automatically before a forced stop — the PreCompact boundary (hooks/handoff-precompact.mjs nudges it), budget ceiling, or error spike.
- `pickup`: a new session opening in a repo with a handoff auto-surfaces it at SessionStart (hooks/handoff-pickup.mjs) and resumes from `## START HERE` — after verifying its claims against git; a stale handoff is refreshed, not trusted blindly.
- `boundary`: the handoff holds the forward map only (START HERE / Queue / In flight / Blockers / Done) — NOT history (git owns that) and NOT decisions (DECISIONS.yaml owns those, logged the same turn).
- `procedure`: the write-handoff skill owns HOW (shape, cadence, rules); this section is the law it complies with.
